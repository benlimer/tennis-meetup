Tennis Meetup by Ben Taehoon Lim

I created this app to help tennis players find other tennis players locally. 
Firstly, a user will be able to find other players by location (which needs to be provided when users sign up) 
The listing of players will have number of matches/ skill rating next to their name, so that a user has better idea who they are playing with. 
Once the user finds a player, one can message them. (messaging is dream features but also core)
After a meetup, they can decide to post match results if a match was played. (have a button to create match results on the partner's showpage) (dream: posting a match result will send the other player for approval)
The app has added functionalities to help players locate courts and leave reviews on them. 
Each user can vote on the reviews of the courts.
